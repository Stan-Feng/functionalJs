## Functional Programming in JavaScript
### Pure function
* No side effects, state
* Each time the function has been called, you're gonna get different result
* Closure is about maintaining the state of a function
* It's a little tiny tool we can use in very technical specific way
* Array returned preferred

### Composition
* Take an output from one function and pass as input to another function
* Immutable binding is not interesting, immutable value is more interesting
* We choose not to change the value of params passed in the function called immutability.

### Recursion (Tail called optimization in JavaScript)
* No one implement this feature until now
* Alternative way to doing this:


### Closure
* In JavaScript, "closure" is when a function remembers the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere
* In mathematic, an operation for combining data objects satisfies the "closure" property if the results of combining things with that operation can themselves be combined using the same operation
