## Prue function
* No side effects, state
* Each time the function has been called, you're gonna get different result
* Closure is about maintaining the state of a function
* It's a little tiny tool we can use in very technical specific way
* Array returned preferred

## Composition
* Take an output from one function and pass as input to another function
* Immutable binding is not interesting, immutable value is more interesting
* We choose not to change the value of params passed in the function called immutability.

## Recursion (Tail called optimization in JavaScript)
* No one implement this feature until now
* Alternative way to doing this:


## Closure
* Closure is when a function remembers the variables around it even when that function is executed elsewhere
